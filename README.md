#Posts and comments management System
The "Posts and Comments Management System" is an application developed using Java 17 and Spring Boot 3 that allows users to manage their posts and comments with ease.

Users can create an account and log in to the application to create new posts, edit existing ones, or delete their posts entirely. They can also leave comments on other users' posts and receive feedback from other community members.

The application provides a powerful tagging system, allowing users to categorize their posts and make them easier to find. This feature also enables users to search for posts based on specific keywords or tags, making it more convenient to locate content related to their interests.

The "Posts and Comments Management System" is designed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, with the front-end built using modern JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. The back-end of the application is implemented using Spring Boot 3, which provides the necessary tools to manage database interactions and handle user requests.

The application is secured using industry-standard authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring that user data remains private and secure. Additionally, the "Posts and Comments Management System" provides user profiles, allowing members of the community to learn more about each other and connect with like-minded individuals.
